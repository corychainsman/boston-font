A modified version of [New York (1983) by Jamie Place (FontBlast)](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/773270/new_york_22), which itself is a recreation of the New York typeface designed in 1983 for the Macintosh computer by Susan Kare and reworked in 1988 by Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(1983_typeface))).

Notably, the ascenders and descenders on the numerals have been shored up.
